# StoryFinder

## Purpose
A React application that lets a user search for a variety of articles on the internet. It calls the REST API: https://hn.algolia.com/api
to access the articles.

## About
I read Road to React by Robin Wieruch, and learned how to build this React application. The following are the concepts I've learned:

* The React syntax
* How to call hooks such as useState and usReducer
* How to create custom hooks
* How to create a memoized handler such as useCallback
* How to call APIs using fetch and axios 
* How to implement a inline handler in JSX
* How to implement infinite pagination (infinite scrolling)

Here's my React application:
