# React StoryFinder

## Purpose
A React application that lets a user search for a variety of articles on the internet. It calls the REST API: https://hn.algolia.com/api
to access the articles.

## About
I read the textbook called Road to React by Robin Wieruch, and learned how to build this React application.
Things I learned:
Markup: *The React syntax
*How to call Hooks such as useState and usReducer
*How to create custom Hooks
*How to create a Memoized Handler such as useCallback
*How to call APIs using fetch and axios 

 Markup : * Bullet list
              * Nested bullet
                  * Sub-nested bullet etc
          * Bullet list item 2
