# StoryFinder
A React app that lets a user search for a variety of articles on the internet. In addition, the app will save the last five searches from the user, and it'll let the user filter the articles based on these properties: Title, Author, Comments, and Points. 

The app calls the REST API: https://hn.algolia.com/api to access the articles. 

## What I'ved learned
I read Road to React by Robin Wieruch and learned how to build this React app. The following are the concepts I've learned:

* The React syntax
* How to call hooks such as useState and usReducer
* How to create custom hooks
* How to create a memoized handler such as useCallback
* How to call APIs using fetch and axios 
* How to implement a inline handler in JSX
* How to implement infinite pagination (infinite scrolling)
